# CMSC-350-Project-4
#### This project will build a Directed Graph and use a depth-first search algorithm.

Takes a fileName, tokenizes contents of said file to build a DGraph. Then takes a className(vertex) in which a sub-graph is topologically sorted from, output as a String.

><h2>CMSC 350</h2>
><p>A study of user-defined data structures and object-oriented design in computer science. The aim is to develop secure Java programs. Topics include linked lists, stacks, queues, arrays, maps, vectors, and trees. Algorithms that perform sorting, searching, and recursion are discussed and analyzed.</p>
